# `03` Calling a Function

`Functions` are **blocks of code** that you save to be (re)used later; that specific fragment of code has a predefined purpose and it does a defined task. A `function` could receive some or no parameters to be able to execute and must always return something.

For example: a function that calculates the area of a square would be something like this:

```js
function calculateArea(length, edge) {
    return length * edge;
}
```

If you want to use that `function` to calculate the area of a square with

```js
length = 3
edge = 6
```

You need to do something like this:

```js
let squareArea = calculateArea(3,6);
```
The value of `squareArea` will be set to `18`.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Create a new variable named `squareArea` for each new iteration of the `calculateArea` function using the dimensions of the following figures:

## Example:

For the first figure:

```js
let squareArea1 = calculateArea(4, 4);
```

For the Second figure:

```js
let squareArea2 = functionCall(x,y);
```

## üí° Hint:

+ Call the `calculateArea` function 3 times, one per each square, passing the length and edge of each square.
